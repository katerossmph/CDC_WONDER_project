Caveats:											
"1. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"											
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"											
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Not Stated.											
"2. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"											
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"											
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Not Stated.											
3. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the											
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"											
of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin											
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"

"4. The population figures for years 2023 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2023"											
"postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 27, 2024. The 2023 series is based on the Modified Blended Base produced"											
"by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Modified Blended Base consists of the blend"											
"of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates for April 1, 2020, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census data"											
from the internal Census Edited File (CEF). The population figures for years 2022 are single-race estimates of the July 1											
"resident population, from the Vintage 2022 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 22, 2023. The 2022 series is"											
"based on the Modified Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The"											
"Modified Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates for April 1, 2020, 2020 Demographic"

"the April 1, 2020 decennial population count, from the Vintage 2021 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 30,"

"2019 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2019 postcensal series based on April 2010"

"June 20, 2019. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Population Data."											
5. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the											
resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Age											
Group.											
"6. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"											
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"											
in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More											
information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/.											
"7. Between December 22, 2020 and February 3, 2021, the county-level race-specific population figures and rates reported for year"											
2018 were inaccurate for queries that reported race-specific categories for single race 6 Race groups in combination for any											
specific County and/or Urbanization categories. The results to such queries erroneously reported inaccurate population values											
and death rates for specific 6 Race categories at the county level. This problem applied to all queries with County and/or											
Urbanization categories and the specific 6 Race categories in year 2018. We apologize for this error.											
"8. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"											
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"											
Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the											
2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and											
"unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22,"											
2020											
"9. After the creation of the final 2023 dataset, North Carolina updated the cause of death information for over 900 death"											
"certificates to include a cause of death code indicating drug overdose (ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes: X40-X44,"											
"X60-X64, X85, and Y10-Y14). Jurisdictions can continue to update death certificates after the closing of the mortality file. As"											
"a result, users should consider that the actual death count for drug overdose deaths for North Carolina in 2023 is over 4,400"											
"deaths, with a crude rate of approximately 41.0 per 100,000 population, and an age-adjusted rate of approximately 42.1 per"											
"100,000 population. These deaths will not be updated on the final mortality datasets."											
10. Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. More information:
